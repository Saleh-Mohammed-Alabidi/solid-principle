# Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

If our classes assume multiple responsibilities, they will be highly coupled thus making them more difficult to maintain.


## What’s a reason to change?
Uncle Bob states that this principle is about people. This means that when you write a software module, and changes are requested on that module, those changes can only originate from a single person or a tightly group of people representing a single narrowly defined business function.
