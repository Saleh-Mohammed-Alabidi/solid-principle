# Dependency Inversion Principle

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

This principle states that a class should not depend on another class, but instead on an abstraction of that class. It allows loose-coupling and more reusability.

Dependency Inversion PrincipleÂ suggests introducing an abstraction layer between our high level and low level objects, so that both high level and low level objects should not depend on each other; instead, both high level and low level object will depend on an abstraction layer.
