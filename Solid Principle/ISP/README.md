# Interface Segregation Principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

This principle states that classes should never implement interfaces that they don’t need to use. If they do, we’ll end up having not implemented methods in our classes. This can be solved creating specific interfaces instead of general-purpose interfaces.

If we define this principle in the easiest way, it is that prevent software objects relying on other objects they do not need and we can implement this principle by using interface and abstract class.
