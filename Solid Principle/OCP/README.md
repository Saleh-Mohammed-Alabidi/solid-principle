# Open-Closed Principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

This principle states that software entities must be extensible without having to modify the existing code. In order to achieve this, we need to make abstractions. By doing this, we’ll be able to extend the behavior of a class without changing a single line of code in it.
